# Hotel Revenue Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hotel revenue data using a combination of SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel. The dataset was initially obtained through web scraping and stored in JSON format. Following this, the data was converted into CSV files for further processing. The entire workflow involved data cleaning, handling missing values, and eliminating duplicates to ensure a high-quality dataset.

## Project Workflow

### Web Scraping and Dataset Creation:

- Utilized web scraping techniques to gather relevant data from various sources.
- Created a dataset in JSON format containing hotel revenue information.

### Conversion to CSV:

- Transformed the JSON files into CSV format for easier handling and compatibility with various tools.

### Data Cleaning:

- Identified and addressed missing values in the dataset.
- Removed duplicates to ensure data accuracy.
- Performed necessary data cleaning procedures to enhance data quality.

### Import into Power BI:

- Imported the cleaned CSV files into Power BI for further analysis and visualization.

### Power BI Data Transformation:

- Conducted additional data transformations within Power BI to refine the dataset.
- Applied Power BI functionalities to enhance the overall data analysis process.

### DAX Measures:

- Utilized Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create meaningful measures for analytical insights.
- Implemented calculations and aggregations to derive relevant business metrics.

### Interactive Dashboard Creation:

- Developed an interactive dashboard within Power BI for effective data visualization.
- Incorporated charts, graphs, and other visual elements to represent hotel revenue trends.
